  L3Cube started as a group of enthusiasts, mainly for mentoring undergrad
  projects. We have mentored a number of undergrad projects in several of the
  following areas - Networking, Storage, Applications. Many of projects
  we have mentored have won awards at national level. This space is more 
  of a braindump of some of the tech stuff that we encountered and/or
  continue to encounter while working on projects, which should also serve as 
  a quick lookup table for us in case we need to refer to something we\'ve done
  in the past (which happens quite often).
